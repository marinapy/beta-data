Much time was spent re-checking the plan to ensure all numbers to be accurate before consult.

The prospect is already maxing out his 401k, FR wanted to show 5% of income going into PLI (which worked fine) but an IRA was still recommended by BW. FR wanted to save in NQ brokerage instead as prospect is already saving well over 10% of income for retirement so some flexible NQ savings seemed more appropriate. Was unable to completely remove IRA being funded, but adding a goal of NQ savings helped accomplish the end goal of the FR. FR felt comfortable talking around the IRA as it was still putting about $150/month into it. "
