Objectives: The objective of the beta app is to automate otherwise tedious and manual work involved in the collection of prospect feedback for the beta launch of LearnVest's financial planning software. The app reads a .csv file containing the prospect data and creates, as an output, a .csv file containing only prospect and relevant data for the identified date range. This is helpful because the data itself is very dirty containing a lot of irrelevant headers, missing email addresses and dates outside of the needed range.

Information inputs: The input is the BetaTracker.csv which contains all of the dirty data.

Information outputs: A .csv that contains only the needed data, ready to upload as a contact list in the survey software.
